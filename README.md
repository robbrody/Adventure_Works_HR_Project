# Overview 
## Introduction
In this project, I set out to analyze a custom Human Resources dataset derived from the Adventure Works 2022 dataset in Microsoft SQL Server. This involved creating a comprehensive SQL view that integrated data from 11 different tables, resulting in a robust dataset comprising 31 columns related to employee information. By importing this dataset into Python, I was able to clean and preprocess the data effectively, eliminating duplicate employee entries and ensuring accuracy in capturing the most recent department and pay information.

Utilizing this refined dataset, I conducted in-depth analyses to explore various employee attributes, including gender, marital status, department, pay frequency, shift, organizational level, salary, and age. The culmination of my efforts was the development of a dynamic dashboard featuring five visually informative charts that present key insights by department within the Adventure Works employee dataset. This dashboard not only highlights critical HR metrics but also serves as a powerful tool for understanding employee demographics and organizational dynamics.

## The Questions

Below are the questions I looked to answer in this project:

1. What are the primary demographic and demographic trends within the Adventure Works workforce?

2. How do the departments at Adventure Works differ in terms of employee composition and characteristics?

3. Are there any opportunities to optimize Adventure Works's hiring practices based on the data?

4. What are the potential enhancements to the dashboard that could maximize its value for decision-making?

## Tools Used for the Analysis

I used the following tools for this analysis:

* **Python**: The main tool for the analysis, used to analyze the data, and find the answer to the questions. The following libraries were used in Python:
    * **Pandas Library**: Used to analyze the data.
    * **Matplotlib Library**: To visualize the data.
    * **Seaborn Library**: Create more advanced visualizations.
    * **Datetime**: Used to format dates.
    * **Funcformatter**: To format text for plots.
    * **Pyodbc**: Used to load data from SQL server.
    * **Panel**: To create dashboards in Python.
* **Jupyter Notebooks**: Tool used to run Python scripts, and easily include notes and analysis.
* **Visual Studio Code**: Program for executing Python scripts.
* **Git & GitHub**: Version control and sharing Python code and analysis.
